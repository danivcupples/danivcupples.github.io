  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a (mostly) self-taught front-end web developer. Currently I'm most comfortable with HTML and CSS, but my JavaScript
    proficiency improves daily. I have used Bootstrap and jQuery to varying degrees of success, but hope to use them more
    and more and I continue to work toward a greater mastery of coding.</p>
    <p>I live in Charlotte, North Carolina with my family, which consists of my husband Houston, our daughter Wendy, and our dog Toby.
    I currently work for <a href="https://www.safecardid.com">Safe-Card ID services</a>, and am working on redesigning our website
    and implementing Magento Community Edition as our ecommerce platform.</p>
    <p>My life runs on coffee. I also like books, bourbon, beer, good food, and good stationery.</p>
